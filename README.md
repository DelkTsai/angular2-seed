Bootstrap Angular 2 apps with Jade + Stylus.

#### Build files & launch server
```
$ gulp serve
```

**launch browser: ** [http://localhost:1981](http://localhost:1981)

_Or_ if you don't want to run the server & simply want to your source files to the build directory:

#### Compile all our source files & output to `build` directory
```
$ gulp serve
```
